Wavestate
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Wavestate is a collection of python libraries for physics, controls systems, and
linear algebra useful for quantum optics and Gravitational Wave interferometers
like LIGO.

In addition, it also contains utility codes and convenience function to help
with coding and "notebook style" development of scientific modeling and
analysis. This style aims to minimize the iteration time between editing code
and seeing either plots or numbers to compare. As code or analysis is developed
and matures, it often increases in length, complexity and, sometimes, the
run-time. The utilities and idioms of wavestate are built to facilitate
translating code between notebooks, "test suite notebooks", and module code. See
`Idioms`_.
